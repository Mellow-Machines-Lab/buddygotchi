"""Speaks the voice bank's planned slots that have no recording yet, so Boop
can say them now, and keeps the list of what to record for real.

A slot is one line in one mood, in the bank's own shape (plans/deferred.json's),
in one of the plans named in PLANS. Each slot with no recording gets a
placeholder take, spoken by espeak-ng (`brew install espeak-ng`; its speech
is free to ship) in a robot voice, pitched and paced by the mood, and
converted with macOS's afconvert to the bank's 8-bit, 11.025 kHz WAV. It
goes into the manifest like any recording, but with `"placeholder": true`
in its `generation` and `reviewStatus: "placeholder"`, and its entry into
dictionary.json if it's new. Nothing in it is acted, so a mood is only its
pitch and pace.

plans/regenerate.json is the list to record for real: every placeholder's
slot, with its script and direction, rewritten on every run from the
manifest. To replace one, record its slot, put the take in the manifest
with the slot's id as its performanceId, and rerun this: the placeholder
and its file go, and so does its line in regenerate.json. Then rerun
voicegen. Run from anywhere:

    python3 characters/boop/tools/voicegen/placeholders.py [--force] [--voice VOICE]

--force speaks every placeholder again (with --voice, in another voice).
